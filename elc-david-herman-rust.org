* Rust
  - low level / systems level programming langauge (compete with c/c++)
  - AOT compiled
** theme
   Safe, Concurrent, Fast
   "love child fo c++ erlang and caml"
     
* problems with c++
  - akward to parrellelize
  - not great for security

* performance
  - important in browsers
  - refrence blog post Robert O'Callahan http://j.mp/abstraction-penalties
** from c++
*** zero cost abstactions
    should be able to create abstractions without performance penalties
** examples
*** lambdas
    lambdas gaurenteed inlining 

* 3 pointers types
  "front loading language complexity"
** normal
** managed pointers
  syntax for managed pointers - memory management
** unique pointer
   only be one owner

* concurancy
  tasks - each task gets its own heap (no stack overflows)
  create pipes
  
* saftey
  stucts
  impl methods
  so can add methods to anything (eg ints)
** traits
   like haskel type-classes
   allow implementing tyings such as pipes that only allow immutable data sharing

** unsafe
   "saftey [...] is a lie"
   implemented a whole unsafe sub-language
   need to declare explicitly

* go vs rust
  rust - more control over perfromance
  go - a bit simpler
