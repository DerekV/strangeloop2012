* Parsing
  - parser combnators (build parsers out of parsers)
  - using a parser's success / failure to determine a match eg palindrom
  - generage 'random' strings matching a given grammer

* termination
  
* laziness
  - proceeed as if we guessed
  - not laziness like haskell , which mutates global shared memory
  - laziness in this sense...
    "non-deterministic laziness need first-class memory

* letlazy
  like unix fork

* thus 
  generate code by guessing


* in other languages
  - "continuation state monad"
    (in scala, haskell)
